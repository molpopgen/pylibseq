Using the package in your own projects
================================

This package's function can be used either directly in Python code.  Alternately, you can use it directly in Cython code, too.  The basic types are defined in Cython ".pxd" files, and are this accessible.  See the Cython documentation for details.

The general form of their use is:

.. code-block:: python

   from lisequence.polytable cimport simData
