  abstract = "In this paper we describe how to efficiently record the entire
              genetic history of a population during a forwards-time,
              individual-based population genetics simulation. This
              dramatically reduces the computational burden of tracking
              individual genomes by simulating only those loci that may affect
              reproduction (those having non-neutral variants), and recording
              history as a succinct tree sequence as introduced in the software
              package msprime, on which neutral mutations can be quickly placed
              afterwards. We implement the method in two popular forwards-time
              simulation frameworks, which speeds up large, whole-genome
              simulations by one to two orders of magnitude. In addition to
              speed, the method has several advantages: (1) All marginal
              genealogies of the simulated individuals are recorded, rather
              than just genotypes. (2) A population of N individuals with M
              polymorphic sites can be stored in O(N log N + M) space, making
              it feasible to store a simulation9s entire final generation (and
              its9 history) rather than only a subset. (3) A simulation can
              easily be initialized with a more efficient coalescent simulation
              of deep history. To make these possible, we introduce the msprime
              Tables API, which allows for the efficient interchange of tree
              sequences between modular program components, and provide an
              algorithm to quickly simplify a tree sequence by removing history
              irrelevant to a given set of genomes.",

  abstract = "A central challenge in the analysis of genetic variation is to
              provide realistic genome simulation across millions of samples.
              Present day coalescent simulations do not scale well, or use
              approximations that fail to capture important long-range linkage
              properties. Analysing the results of simulations also presents a
              substantial challenge, as current methods to store genealogies
              consume a great deal of space, are slow to parse and do not take
              advantage of shared structure in correlated trees. We solve these
              problems by introducing sparse trees and coalescence records as
              the key units of genealogical analysis. Using these tools, exact
              simulation of the coalescent with recombination for
              chromosome-sized regions over hundreds of thousands of samples is
              possible, and substantially faster than present-day approximate
              methods. We can also analyse the results orders of magnitude more
              quickly than with existing methods.",

  abstract = "By comparing the low-, intermediate-, and high-frequency parts of
              the frequency spectrum, we gain information on the evolutionary
              forces that influence the pattern of polymorphism in population
              samples. We emphasize the high-frequency variants on which
              positive selection and negative (background) selection exhibit
              different effects. We propose a new estimator of theta (the
              product of effective population size and neutral mutation rate),
              thetaL, which is sensitive to the changes in high-frequency
              variants. The new thetaL allows us to revise Fay and Wu's H-test
              by normalization. To complement the existing statistics (the
              H-test and Tajima's D-test), we propose a new test, E, which
              relies on the difference between thetaL and Watterson's thetaW.
              We show that this test is most powerful in detecting the recovery
              phase after the loss of genetic diversity, which includes the
              postselective sweep phase. The sensitivities of these tests to
              (or robustness against) background selection and demographic
              changes are also considered. Overall, D and H in combination can
              be most effective in detecting positive selection while being
              insensitive to other perturbations. We thus propose a joint test,
              referred to as the DH test. Simulations indicate that DH is
              indeed sensitive primarily to directional selection and no other
              driving forces.",

              both soft and hard sweeps in population genomic data from a
              single population. We compare our new method with classic
              single-population haplotype and site frequency spectrum
              (SFS)-based methods and show that it is more robust, particularly
              to recombination rate variation. However, all statistics show
              some sensitivity to the assumptions of the demographic model.
              Additionally, we show that nSL has at least as much power as
              other methods under a number of different selection scenarios,
              most notably in the cases of sweeps from standing variation and
              incomplete sweeps. This conclusion holds up under a variety of
              demographic models. In many aspects, our new method is similar to
              the iHS statistic; however, it is generally more robust and does
              not require a genetic map. To illustrate the utility of our new
              method, we apply it to HapMap3 data and show that in the Yoruban
              population, there is strong evidence of selection on genes
              relating to lipid metabolism. This observation could be related
              to the known differences in cholesterol levels, and lipid
              metabolism more generally, between African Americans and other
              populations. We propose that the underlying causes for the

              neutral variation. In the restrictive case when there is no

              is present but rare, both deterministic and stochastic models of
              positive selection show that linked variation hitchhikes to
              either low or high frequencies. While the frequency distribution
              of variation can be influenced by a number of evolutionary
              processes, an excess of derived variants at high frequency is a
              unique pattern produced by hitchhiking (derived refers to the
              nonancestral state as determined from an outgroup). We adopt a
              statistic, H, to measure an excess of high compared to
              intermediate frequency variants. Only a few high-frequency
              variants are needed to detect hitchhiking since not many are

              regions of low recombination where there is not much variation
              and in regions of normal or high recombination, where the
              hitchhiking effect can be limited to a small (<1 kb) region.
              Application of the H test to published surveys of Drosophila
              variation reveals an excess of high frequency variants that are
              likely to have been influenced by positive selection.",

              average number of nucleotide differences estimated from pairwise
              comparison, is investigated. It is found that the correlation
              between these two estimates is large when the sample size is

              the relationship obtained, a statistical method for testing the

              the data of DNA polymorphism, namely the genetic variation within

              The two quantities of interest are R, the number of recombination
              events in the history of a sample of sequences, and RM, the
              number of recombination events that can be parsimoniously
              inferred from a sample of sequences. Formulas are derived for the
              mean and variance of R. In contrast to R, RM can be determined
              from the sample. Since no formulas are known for the mean and
              variance of RM, they are estimated with Monte Carlo simulations.
              It is found that RM is often much less than R, therefore, the

              a parsimonious reconstruction of the history of a sample. The

              adaptive haplotypes sweep through the population simultaneously,
              producing distinct patterns of genetic variation in the vicinity
              of the adaptive site. Current statistical methods were expressly
              designed to detect hard sweeps and most lack power to detect soft
              sweeps. This is particularly unfortunate for the study of
              adaptation in species such as Drosophila melanogaster, where all
              three confirmed cases of recent adaptation resulted in soft
              selective sweeps and where there is evidence that the effective

              rather than hard sweeps. We discuss the implications of these
