pylibseq: Python bindings for libsequence
***************************************************************

This package provides Python_ bindings for the C++11 library libsequence_.

The bindings are implemented using Cython_.

This package serves two roles:

* It provides a means of using some of the more widely-used bits of libsequence_ within the Python language
* The unit tests of this package also serve as unit tests for libsequence_.

What this package does **not** (currently) do:

* provide an interface for I/O operations.  Python I/O and C++ I/O are fundamentally very different.  Bridging the gap requires either adding features to Cython and/or adding modules to this package that depend on the boost_ Python interface, which would add an additional C++ dependency to this package.

Build status
==========================================

Master branch:

.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/molpopgen/pylibseq.svg?branch=master
   :target: https://travis-ci.org/molpopgen/pylibseq
   :alt: Travis CI Build Status (master branch)

Development branch:

.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/molpopgen/pylibseq.svg?branch=dev
   :target: https://travis-ci.org/molpopgen/pylibseq
   :alt: Travis CI Build Status (dev branch)

Requirements:
===================================

* libsequence_ must be installed on your system.  **Currently, this package requires the dev branch of libsequence**
* TBB_ must be installed on your system.
* Python 2 or Python 3
* An up-to-date C++ compiler that is C++11 compatible via the flag -std=c++11.  Roughly, this means GCC >= 4.8 and clang >= 3.5.

..note:: If you installing from GitHub, then Cython_ is a dependency.

The recommended method for installing libsequence_ is bioconda_.  If you do not use that system, then you should install libsequence_ from source.

If you want to modify the package, you will need Cython_ installed via your favorite Python package manager.

The supported platforms are Linux and OS X.

Changelog (rough)
==============================

* 0.1.9: Made memory management more robust: more unique_ptr instead of raw pointers.  Cleanup __dealloc__ functions in extension types.  Package now sets __version__.  Class names are now "Pythonic" (and identical to the corresponding type names from libsequence) due to aliasing the C++ names from libsequence. Change from distutils to setuptools.  Documentation fixes.  Expose haplotype diversity and number of haplotype statistics.  First (very alpha) release of pymsstats.
* 0.1.8: made sure C++ objects/fxns are declared "nogil".  Raw pointers replaced with C++'s unique_ptr.
* 0.1.7: improvements to build system.  Add option to build from GitHub.
* 0.1.6: update to libsequence 1.8.9.  Add --use-cython option to setup.py

Installation:
=======================

The latest release of the package is available via PyPi_, and can be installed with your favorite Python package manager:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install --upgrade pylibseq

Or, you may install from GitHub:

.. note:: The GitHub version does not contain the .cpp files generated by Cython.  You need to generate those!

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone http://github.com/molpopgen/pylibseq
   $ cd pylibseq

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ./configure
   $ sudo pip install . --install-option=--use-cython

You may also install from GitHub using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install git+git://github.com/molpopgen/pylibseq --install-option=--use-cython

If you have libsequence in a "funny location" (*e.g.*, something other that /usr/local):

.. code-block:: bash

   $ CPPFLAGS=-I/path/to/libsequence/headers LDFLAGS=-L/path/to/libsequence/library sudo python setup.py install --use-cython

For example, if libsequence is installed into /opt:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/include LDFLAGS=-L/opt/lib sudo python setup.py install

Unit testing:
=======================

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ./configure
   $ python setup.py build_ext -i --use-cython
   $ python -m unittest discover unit_test

Modifying the package
=======================

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python setup.py build_ext -i --use-cython
